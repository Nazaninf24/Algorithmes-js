# Algorithmes Projects  

## How to run :

- Clone or download the `Algorithmes` project folder,

- There are 2 projects folders inside, Open each folder separately into your terminal :

- In the first folder `projet1_tri` there are sorting projects. To use it just run :

  - $ node sorting_functions.js list.txt  
  In the console (to see Bubble and Insert sorting programs) working with `list.txt` and change it to`list2.txt` numbers.

  - $ node merge_sort.js list.txt 
   - (to see the Merge sort program in action (using `list.txt` and  change it to`list2.txt`). 

- The second algorithmes projects are in `projet2_algos` folder. Proceed the same way to run tests with the `numbers.txt` file :

  - $ node ex1.js numbers.txt `10`
  (change the names of exos files .js to test them all)
  (You can also insert the required number at the end of it to test)

 Enjoy
